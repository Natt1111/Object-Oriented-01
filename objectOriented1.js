//Part one
//Create a class for vehicle. Each vehicle instance should have the following properties:

//make
//model
//year
//Each vehicle instance should have access to a method called honk, which returns the string “Beep.”
//Each vehicle instance should have a method called toString, which returns the string containing the make, model and year.

class Vehicle {
   constructor(make, model, year) {
      this.make = make;
      this.model = model;
      this.year = year;
}
        
      honk() {
         return "Beep.";
}
        
      toString() {
         return `The vehicle is a ${this.make} ${this.model} from ${this.year}.`;
}
}
        
// Example usage:

let myFirstVehicle = new Vehicle("Honda", "Monster Truck", 1999);
console.log(myFirstVehicle.honk()); // "Beep."
console.log(myFirstVehicle.toString()); // "The vehicle is a Honda Monster Truck from 1999."
//Part Two
//Create a class for a car. The Car class should inherit from Vehicle and each car instance should have a property called numWheels which has a value of 4.

class Car extends Vehicle {
   constructor(make, model, year) {
      super(make, model, year);
         this.numWheels = 4;
}
//use example
let myFirstCar = new Car("Toyota", "Corolla" , 2005);
console.log(myFirstCar.toString()); // "The vehicle is a Toyota Corolla from 2005."
console.log(myFirstCar.honk());     // "Beep."
console.log(myFirstCar.numWheels);  // 4

//Part Three
//Create a class for a Motorcycle. This class should inherit from Vehicle and each motorcycle instance should have a property called numWheels which has a value of 2. It should also have a revEngine method which returns “VROOM!!!”
class Motorcycle extends Vehicle {
   constructor(make, model, year) {
      super(make, model, year);
         this.numWheels = 2;
}
   revEngine() {
      return "VROOM!!!";
          }
        }

// Example usage:
let myFirstMotorcycle = new Motorcycle("Honda", "Nighthawk", 2000);
console.log(myFirstMotorcycle.toString()); // "The vehicle is a Honda Nighthawk from 2000."
console.log(myFirstMotorcycle.honk());     // "Beep."
console.log(myFirstMotorcycle.revEngine()); // "VROOM!!!"
console.log(myFirstMotorcycle.numWheels);  // 2

//Part Four
//Create a class for a Garage. It should have a property called vehicles which will store an array of vehicles, and a property called capacity which is a number indicating how many vehicles will fit in the garage. When you create a garage, vehicles will always be empty; you only need to provide the capacity.

//A garage should also have an add method, which attempts to add a vehicle to the array of vehicles. However, if you try to add something which is not a vehicle, the garage should return the message “Only vehicles are allowed in here!”. Also, if the garage is at capacity, it should say “Sorry, we’re full.”

class Garage {
   constructor(capacity) {
      this.vehicles = [];
      this.capacity = capacity;
}
        
    add(newVehicle) {
       if (!(newVehicleehicle instanceof Vehicle)) {
        return "Only vehicles are allowed in here!";
}
       if (this.vehicles.length >= this.capacity) {
        return "Sorry, we're full.";
}
       this.vehicles.push(newVehicleehicle);
       return "Vehicle added!";
}
}
// Example usage:
let garage = new Garage(2);
console.log(garage.vehicles); // []
console.log(garage.add(new Car("Hyundai", "Elantra", 2015))); // "Vehicle added!"
console.log(garage.vehicles); // [Car]
console.log(garage.add("Taco")); // "Only vehicles are allowed in here!"
        
console.log(garage.add(new Motorcycle("Honda", "Nighthawk", 2000))); // "Vehicle added!"
console.log(garage.vehicles); // [Car, Motorcycle]
        
console.log(garage.add(new Motorcycle("Honda", "Nighthawk", 2001))); // "Sorry, we're full."
